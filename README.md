# Welcome!

In this repo you will become aquainted with my various attempts to dive into machine learning. I've tried following various blogs, watched a bunch of tutorials on youtube, and even signed up for an online course or two in order to gain some insight into the exciting field of machine learning. I'll leave you to poke around the different notbooks I've created that summarize my different attempts. Enjoy!
